Thank you so much. I'm really excited to be here today to talk about Openscapes and working towards more open, reproducible, inclusive practices for research teams and communities

Transition: the main points I'd like you to take away is that;

---
# MAIN POINT

Main point:: open science is a movement that will help you do BSILT

It includes you. 

Key to this is to focus on several things at the same time:
- data science
- teamwork
- diversity, equity, and inclusion 
You engage with this movement through teams. And what I'd like you to leave this talk with is the idea that teams and community are all around you, supporting you in your research. 

THEME: As open science improves your daily life, you can also give back and help others. This is what the open science movement is. 


Main point:: Open, Reliable, and Transparent is a team effort  And what I'd like you to leave this talk with is the idea that teams and community are all around you, supporting you in your research.

Over the past decade I've been learning a ton about

# Openscapes 

helps research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, 
and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities.

Engage • Empower • Amplify


SEEDS slide 2

Maybe Slide 3 too

??
Means so much I've moved away from doing my own research to pass forward.

We're always going to find ourselves in situations where we don't have the skillsets to solve the challenges we face.

But there are powerful approaches around us, as powerful as the force. This is open science. There are mentors around us that can help, and although it's real work to upskill, we can become confident in the skills we need

and become part of a team. We all do science, so we all are on many teams of different scales. The most clear is our own lab, then the open source community

# OHI + Openscapes

So I'd like to talk about 2 examples

## Open science as a movement

Open science is a movement that will help you do BSILT. 
GOTV. 

Daily benefit that then you can pass forward. 

DEI is a huge part of this.

SORTEE GSlide 7: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HGw4P095-lblHiGQHXYidHiVysjrPxuojxTxKtE13vk/edit#slide=id.gddac11ba17_0_174

Co-create, less re-inventing. more inclusion and belonging.

# OHI and Openscapes logos


???
I'll tell you about 2 examples: teams. 

You engage with this movement through teams.


Open science is a movement that will help you do better science in less time, and it's something that all ecologists can be a part of

(And while these days, we both feel like working as data scientists and teachers in R is a wonderfully supportive, collaborative, and inspiring space to work. But we didn’t always feel like this. )

## It’s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety.

Communicate collaboratively (for future us)

Rmd also helped us teach and iterate

# Open Data Science

Data science is an entryway to open science: turn open science from an idea to a daily benefit

???

For me it was really the R community that introduced and welcomed me to open science. These groups helped me feel welcome and included and helped me see that data science is an entryway to open science from an idea to a daily benefit

science as a movement that we could be a part of and that was a daily benefit to our work

. ENTRYWAY.
Many entryways to open science: I've seen data science as a criticaly entryway that meets researchers' immediate needs

So how do you do that? through teams.
