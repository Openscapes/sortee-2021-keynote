Thank you so much. I'm really excited to be here today to talk about Openscapes and working towards more open, reproducible, inclusive practices for research teams and communities

I'm so happy to have the chance to speak with you all today because —

---
# Cascadia Intro

# Hello. I'm Julie. 

<2 pics: squid release, teaching at mbari>

??

I'm a marine ecologist turned open science champion. And what I'd like to talk with you today is about how we can move to towards more open, reproducible, inclusive practices for research teams and communities"

# Open science is a movement that will help you do BSILT. 

You engage with this movement through teams.

Many entryways to open science: I've seen data science as a criticaly entryway that meets researchers' immediate needs  and 

THEME: As open science improves your daily life, you can also give back and help others. This is what the open science movement is. 


Main point:: Open, Reliable, and Transparent is a team effort  And what I'd like you to leave this talk with is the idea that teams and community are all around you, supporting you in your research.

# Openscapes 

helps research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, 
and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities.

Engage • Empower • Amplify

Maybe Slide 3 too

??
Means so much I've moved away from doing my own research to pass forward. 

Mozilla Fellowship, Openscapes, operated at NCEAS, Co-directed with Erin Robinson. 

I'm driven by statements from my colleagues like this: 

---
Chelsea Wood quote

this feeling of not feeling prepared 

---
Luke

We're always going to find ourselves in situations where we don't have the skillsets to solve the challenges we face. 

---
Yoda

But there are powerful approaches around us, as powerful as the force. This is open science. There are mentors around us that can help, and although it's real work to upskill, we can become confident in the skills we need

---
team

and become part of a team. We all do science, so we all are on many teams of different scales. The most clear is our own lab, then the open source community 

---
## Open science as a movement

Define open science? 
GOTV. 

Daily benefit that then you can pass forward. 

DEI is a huge part of this.

Co-create, less re-inventing. more inclusion and belonging.

# BSILT feedback:

we're not a team. Chelsea quote? I didn't realize there was a problem

# DEI is a huge part of this.

Focus is on helping researchers find their teams and communities. Explore and navigate
Join the open science movement

Not just about tools, DEI

# Main message: open, reproducible, inclusive practices

## 2 sub-messages
collab coding: less reinventing 
collab comms: streamline onboarding

All Together Now: more co-creation, reimagine science.

# Sub-message #1: 
Code collaboratively (for future us?)

## It’s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety.

# Submessage #2
Communicate collaboratively (for future us)

RMarkdown. (7 min)

Rmd also helped us teach and iterate

- OHI training modeled after Carpentries' structure, but to onboard people to our workflow. 
- this is now an incubator at the Carpentries and was part of the foundation for
- R for Excel taught at RSTudio Conf
Allowed us to give back

NASA too. 

- introduce another layer: Mentors cohort

# How you get involved 

- start talkign about data
- identify and address shared needs
- think ahead for future us.
