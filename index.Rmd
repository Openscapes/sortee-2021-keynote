Thank you so much. I'm really excited to be here today to talk about Openscapes: Better Science for Future Us


Transition: The idea of Better Science for Future Us motivates all of now, so much so that I've moved away from doing my own research and co-direct Openscapes to help other researchers do open, inslusive ...

Better Science for Future Us is about science that is more reproducible, open, and efficient, and also collaborative, inclusive, and kind, and where all these principles are part of our daily practice of science. These ideas have been so transformational for me as a researcher that I actually have moved away from doing my own research so I can help empower other researchers doing data-intensive science. 

transition: And this is important because default approaches to data-intensive research feel like this.

This is Luke Skywalker when he crashed his plane into the swamp of Dagobah, and he is staring at a challenge he can’t solve with the skillsets he has. I felt demoralized like this as a graduate student when I was first learning how to code, and then again with my research team as we were struggling to code together. I felt like this in big ways like overhauling the workflows that I’d developed over my whole career and small ways like missing a parentheses or trying to distinguish between 10 files with names ending in final_final and final_final_final. I constantly felt that I was alone, behind, and that it was too late to catch up.

 Luckily, this isn’t the end of Luke’s story, because as we know –

CUT: 
(nasem): But the current default approaches to data analysis are closed and individual and demoralizing. Like Luke Skywalker here, most researchers cannot solve the the challenges in front of us with the skillsets we have because we are never trained. Instead, we are self-taught using the same closed tools that the self-taught researchers before us did, and these closed tools perpetuate closed mindsets and apprehension about participating in open science.

[transition] But it doesn’t have to be this way.


Like luke, staring at challenges we can't solve with the skillsets we have. And the thing is, we can't solve this in a good way on our own. No matter what kinds of workarounds we might design to solve this problem, it's not going to be enough to meaningingfulyly contribute in a way that we can continue to learn from and repeat.

Luke meets Yoda. And Yoda uses the Force to solve Luke’s problem in a way Luke never imagined was possible. The Force is going to open up Luke's whole world because it will solve his current challenge and also broaden his mindset to what is possible in the future. For me, the Force is open science. And I’ve met many Yodas in the R and open science communities who supported me as a new learner and helped me feel like I wasn’t alone and that it wasn’t too late. My Yodas were people I met at my very first open science event. which was an rOpenSci unconference. They were RLadies who role modeled how support women and promote gender diversity in the R community, and folks from RStudio who were patient with my questions as I tried to understand how RMarkdown could be used not only for reproducibility but for communicating science beyond my wildest dreams.

CUT::

(nasem): Open data science approaches are open, collaborative, & empowering – to me it’s like the Force. Open data science enables us to solve challenges in ways we never would have imagined was possible. But it doesn’t just solve the challenges in front of us, it will also broaden our mindsets for the scope and scale of the research questions we can tackle. 


Luckily, don't have to. Because open science is something as powerful as the force that we can learn and participate in. It's something we could never imagine on our own, or design on our own, and nor should we. We have other responsibilities and this is something we can learn and be a part of

???

The R and open science communities helped me work more reproducibly and collaborate better with my research team. But they also taught me that there are teams all around me. Learning modern tools for data analysis and becoming part of the open science movement has made me completely reimagine how I define teams. I used to think that collaborators were limited to people working on a specific project with me. But now I think of collaborators as people who enrich my work through the packages they develop or the teaching resources they share. I again think in terms of of Star Wars, where teams were powerful because they were diversity in terms of backgrounds and expertise, and everyone contributed in really critical ways towards a shared vision.


CUT::

(nasem): And this open community is powerful because it is diverse and inclusive. Feeling included in this open community has been game-changing for my science, and my life.   So let me tell you a bit more about this and how I am now focused on training and mentoring researchers with open data science. 

And being a part of is key. This is not something you do alone. 

Focus on Future Us. Research teams still don’t know how to work as teams.

# Rey

???

Learning from communities and figuring out how to work collaboratively with my many teams put me on a new path that has made me feel so empowered and less alone for my data analysis. And I wanted all researchers to feel like this too, and to pass forward what I’ve learned – 

---
# Champions illustration mit logo

???

This idea of finding your teams and feeling less alone with data analysis is the central idea for Openscapes. 

dentify their trailhead, find the force. abruptly transitioning metaphors here but the idea is to move from the sad lonely research on the bottom left to finding teams and trailheads and navigating the open data science landscape safely. Not a scary, inaccessible, or inhospitable landscape.

Vision: Providing people an opportunity to see that it can be different. Ripple out. True culture change.

# Why is this important

# open science tooling & practices along with promoting DEI help us ask better questions

## And when we ask better questions and work together, we can find more inclusive solutions faster

# OHI+Openscapes

???

Openscapes comes from my personal personal story as a researcher through the OHI and how through that I saw a bigger pattern that needed to be solved. And this is the 10 year anniversary of OHI so it's a good time to reflect on that as origins for Openscapes. 

---
exclude: TRUE
Lessons learned: 

- default approaches to science aren't reproducible, efficient, or inclusive
- code openly & teach through the R community
- practice open science through the OHI
- be an open leader through Mozilla

<!---And I'm still learning
I learned how to flywheel with Erin Robinson
I learned how to be braver with Tara Robertson ---->

???
How can I combine these things and what I learned into a program that could accelerate teams doing open science and data science with community

I was turned into a Champion for open science because it transformed the way I work and the way I think. I wanted to pass this forward. Through the Champions program. 


---
# OHI intro

research + training

???

My job with OHI for 6+ years was to contribute to our annual global assessment and lead the OHI+ program to help other teams use our science. An opportunity for me to learn closely doing research with my team and then turn around and help other teams

OHI informed how I work with people around data. I needed to fundamentally do my work in a diff way. I saw that other teams were having that same trouble. Seeing that others need that too. That’s what Openscapes is. 

(used open data from the start. combining ~100 open data sets. but our code and analysis was closed.)

We learned the hard way we couldn’t reproduce our own work
But not just about reproducibility – 
Difficult to iterate or build from our own work (so much reinventing!)
Difficult to onboard new people and offboard (so much knowledge lost when people leave)

Identify how people work, identify the common parts where we are all reinventing. One concrete example: we were all spending a ton of time with Country names. 

Let me started talking about data and analysis we realized they were tedious common things we were all doing whether that was consolidating species names or location names saving data making plots we were all reinventing so through talking about this we were able to start putting that common code somewhere else where we could all you know somewhere where we could all access it and then normalize doing that this then let us find other common not only common problems but common ways to innovate together and take the next step we work on common documentation and then common automation and upskilling.

# MAIN POINT

Main point:: open science is a movement that will help you do BSILT

It includes you. 

Key to this is to focus on several things at the same time:
- data science
- teamwork
- diversity, equity, and inclusion 
You engage with this movement through teams. And what I'd like you to leave this talk with is the idea that teams and community are all around you, supporting you in your research. 

THEME: As open science improves your daily life, you can also give back and help others. This is what the open science movement is. 


Main point:: Open, Reliable, and Transparent is a team effort  And what I'd like you to leave this talk with is the idea that teams and community are all around you, supporting you in your research.

# Open Science

“A collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding” Ramachandran et al. 2021

???

A definition of open science that really resonates with us is that it is “A collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding”.

# Open Data Science

Data science is an entryway to open science: turn open science from an idea to a daily benefit

???

For me it was really the R community that introduced and welcomed me to open science. These groups helped me feel welcome and included and helped me see that data science is an entryway to open science from an idea to a daily benefit

science as a movement that we could be a part of and that was a daily benefit to our work

. ENTRYWAY.
Many entryways to open science: I've seen data science as a criticaly entryway that meets researchers' immediate needs

So how do you do that? through teams.
