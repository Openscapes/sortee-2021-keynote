Thank you so much. I'm really excited to be here today to talk about Openscapes: Better Science for Future Us

Better science is science that is more open and reproducible, it's more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and just, and it is for Future Us: the ideas of our teams, etc. Esp important in environmental science  

Better science for Future Us is about spending less time reinventing and more time collaborating and co-creating, and 

transition: it's particularly important for us in  data-intensive science,  because default approaches to data-intensive research feel like this.

Data-intensive science can be super lonely and demoralizing. Like Luke Skywalker here, we’ve all had moments where we are staring at a challenge that we can’t solve with the skillsets we have. As a marine ecologist I felt demoralized like this when I was a graduate student first learning how to code, and then again with my research team as we were struggling to collaborate with code. This slows us down and slows down our science, as we feel more and more alone, behind, and like it’s too late to catch up.

But it doesn’t have to be like this –

---
class: top, center
```{r yoda, out.width = '88%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/horst-starwars-yoda.jpg") 
```


???

Open science is collaborative and empowering – it’s like the Force from Star Wars. Like the Force, open science enables us to solve data challenges in ways we never would have imagined was possible. Open science is something we can see and learn and become confident with, and it doesn’t just help us get unstuck from the current challenge in front of us, it also broadens our mindsets for the scope and scale of the research questions we can tackle. I felt the power of open science first through the R community who supported me as a new learner and helped me feel like I wasn’t alone and that it wasn’t too late.

???

And so like the Force, open science is something that brings us together. Diverse, inclusive teams and communities are key here, so that we can learn from each other’s expertise and experiences and work together to address pressing issues like climate change and climate justice that none of us can do alone. 

So these ideas of data science, open science, and teamwork are the key motivators of Openscapes. 

And when we’re not thinking of open science like the Force –

???

We think about open science like a landscape. Our flagship program is Openscapes Champions, which is an open data science mentorship program for teams. We help researchers move from sad and lonely science like the animals on the bottom left to team science as they identify their common needs and start navigating the landscape together with a cohort of their peers. We help them orient to existing pathways in the landscape created by open science communities, and we also build new trails when there is a need. 

Transition: So feeling included in open science is a big part of Openscapes

<!---We’ve now mentored 5 Cohorts with 34 environmental research teams since we started in 2018 –

This idea of finding your teams and feeling less alone with data analysis is the central idea for Openscapes. 

identify their trailhead, find the force. abruptly transitioning metaphors here but the idea is to move from the sad lonely research on the bottom left to finding teams and trailheads and navigating the open data science landscape safely. Not a scary, inaccessible, or inhospitable landscape.

Vision: Providing people an opportunity to see that it can be different. Ripple out. True culture change.  --->

Julie: And another part is helping teams see open science and data science as part of their daily workflow. This means recognizing and expecting that tooling and practices already exist and are available to them to make their analytical life more efficient, resilient, and also enjoyable.

# Better Science for Future Us

open science tooling & practices along with promoting DEI help us ask better questions

And when we ask better questions and work together, we can find more inclusive solutions faster 

## Less lonely science
## Less reinventing
## Learn from the community
## Practice as a team

# OHI+Openscapes

???

So I want to step back for a second, because a lot of the focus of Openscapes was what I learned through doing collaborative data-intensive research with my team through the Ocean Health Index. 

I’ve worked with the Ocean Health Index since 2013 and there is a lot to say about it that I won't get into today. What’s relevant here is that we combine and model lots of data, we repeat our analyses every year, and we do it as a team. And, because we are a team of marine ecologists, we all came with varying levels of self-taught analytical experience. 

So we found out the hard way that our default approaches for 
data analysis were not reproducible by even ourselves.

Getting through this involved quite a reckoning, but when we got through it, we knew we had a story to tell.

### We learned the hard way we couldn’t reproduce our work

**So much time lost and effort wasted:**

- Difficult to iterate or build from our own work (so much reinventing!)
- Difficult to onboard & offboard team members (so many undoc'd steps & knowledge lost)

**Reproducibility is also about *co-developing* analyses**

<!---

- **Required new skillsets & mindsets**

- **Possible because of trust, teamwork, & leadership**

This fig shows that as we repeated our analyses each year, they were easier to reproduce and it was easier to collaborate, and it took less time each year. We introduced open data science tools and practices iteratively, first focused on repeatability, then collaboration, and now we're focused on training.

We focused on tools and shared practices that enabled us to work better together. 


Focused on the tools. This paper really resonates with a lot of people. But I also got feedback from early career scientists that I respect, who said: 

---

## "But I work alone. I'm not part of a team."

## "But I don't repeat my work"

## "But I wouldn't know where to start"


---
There were more stories to tell, and more ways to support people. 

And I realized there was a lot more I could do to make this real for people. 

I started telling these stories through Openscapes, The inaugural cohort was in 2019.

Identify how people work, identify the common parts where we are all reinventing. One concrete example: we were all spending a ton of time with Country names. 

Let me started talking about data and analysis we realized they were tedious common things we were all doing whether that was consolidating species names or location names saving data making plots we were all reinventing so through talking about this we were able to start putting that common code somewhere else where we could all you know somewhere where we could all access it and then normalize doing that this then let us find other common not only common problems but common ways to innovate together and take the next step we work on common documentation and then common automation and upskilling.

# MAIN POINT

Main point:: open science is a movement that will help you do BSILT

It includes you. 

Key to this is to focus on several things at the same time:
- data science
- teamwork
- diversity, equity, and inclusion 
You engage with this movement through teams. And what I'd like you to leave this talk with is the idea that teams and community are all around you, supporting you in your research. 

THEME: As open science improves your daily life, you can also give back and help others. This is what the open science movement is.

# Open Science

“A collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding” Ramachandran et al. 2021

???

A definition of open science that really resonates with us is that it is “A collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding”.

# Open Data Science

Data science is an entryway to open science: turn open science from an idea to a daily benefit

???

For me it was really the R community that introduced and welcomed me to open science. These groups helped me feel welcome and included and helped me see that data science is an entryway to open science from an idea to a daily benefit

science as a movement that we could be a part of and that was a daily benefit to our work

. ENTRYWAY.
Many entryways to open science: I've seen data science as a criticaly entryway that meets researchers' immediate needs

So how do you do that? through teams.

Lessons learned: 

- default approaches to science aren't reproducible, efficient, or inclusive
- code openly & teach through the R community
- practice open science through the OHI
- be an open leader through Mozilla

<!---And I'm still learning
I learned how to flywheel with Erin Robinson
I learned how to be braver with Tara Robertson ---->

???
How can I combine these things and what I learned into a program that could accelerate teams doing open science and data science with community

I was turned into a Champion for open science because it transformed the way I work and the way I think. I wanted to pass this forward. Through the Champions program.

And when we are working closely with partners who are engaged with data analysis decisions, we have been able to create dashboards as well. 

This all truly transformed the way that we work and think about science.
