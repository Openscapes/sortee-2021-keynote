Thank you so much. I'm really excited to be here today to talk about Openscapes: Better Science for Future Us


Transition: the motivation for all my work now is that default approaches to data-intensive research feel like this.

## OHI Team Pathway

???

We shared our story here about the tools. Table 1. I want to talk more about the behind-the-scenes, what we didn't describe in the paper but what is key to making this all happen.

## Create space: how to talk about data
### "Seaside Chats"

???

Seaside chats. PI-supported, not attended. 
Seaside chats. Prioritize time. Shared space. Normalize. Build up space to ask these questions, develop vocabulary around them. (stuff from CSCCE slides?)
PI doesn't need more meetings. TRUST WITHIN TEAM.

Identify how people work, identify the common parts where we are all reinventing. One concrete example: we were all spending a ton of time with Country names. 

Let me started talking about data and analysis we realized they were tedious common things we were all doing whether that was consolidating species names or location names saving data making plots we were all reinventing so through talking about this we were able to start putting that common code somewhere else where we could all you know somewhere where we could all access it and then normalize doing that this then let us find other common not only common problems but common ways to innovate together and take the next step we work on common documentation and then common automation and upskilling.
