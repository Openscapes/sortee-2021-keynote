Thank you so much. I'm really excited to be here today to talk about R and teamwork for better science in less time. 

I'm so happy to have the chance to speak with you all today because —

# Hello. I'm Julie. 

I'm a marine ecologist turned open data science champion

# open science is a movement that will help you do BSILT. You engage with this movement through teams.

Key takeaway: 

Main point:: Open, Reliable, and Transparent is a team effort:  And what I'd like you to leave this talk with is the idea that teams and community are all around you, supporting you in your research. 

THEME: As open science improves your daily life, you can also give back and help others. This is what the open science movement is.

# SEEDS slide 2

Maybe Slide 3 too

??
Means so much I've moved away from doing my own research to pass forward.

We're always going to find ourselves in situations where we don't have the skillsets to solve the challenges we face.

Yoda

But there are powerful approaches around us, as powerful as the force. This is open science. There are mentors around us that can help, and although it's real work to upskill, we can become confident in the skills we need

team

and become part of a team. We all do science, so we all are on many teams of different scales. The most clear is our own lab, then the open source community

## Open science as a movement

Define open science? 
GOTV. 

Daily benefit that then you can pass forward. 

DEI is a huge part of this.

SORTEE GSlide 7: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HGw4P095-lblHiGQHXYidHiVysjrPxuojxTxKtE13vk/edit#slide=id.gddac11ba17_0_174

Co-create, less re-inventing. more inclusion and belonging.

(Feedback loop?)

---
R communities

We got into open science because we were deliberately welcomed by the R community. ODS is like the Force, it's not something youre' going to come up with on your own unless you see adn are welcomed. 

First some background:

# BSILT feedback:

we're not a team. Chelsea quote? I didn't realize there was a problem

# DEI is a huge part of this.

# Champions illustration

Focus is on helping researchers find their teams and communities. Explore and navigate
Join the open science movement

Not just about tools, DEI

## It’s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety.

Communicate collaboratively (for future us)

RMarkdown. (7 min)

Rmd also helped us teach and iterate
