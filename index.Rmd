Thank you so much. I'm really excited to be here today to talk about Openscapes: Better Science for Future Us


Transition: the motivation for all my work now is that default approaches to data-intensive research feel like this.

Luke

Like luke, staring at chanllenges we can't solve with the skillsets we have. And the thing is, we can't solve this in a good way on our own. No matter what kinds of workarounds we might design to solve this problem, it's not going to be enough to meaningingfulyly contribute in a way that we can continue to learn from and repeat. 

---
Yoda

???

Luckily, don't have to. Because open science is something as powerful as the force that we can learn and participate in. It's something we could never imagine on our own, or design on our own, and nor should we. We have other responsibilities and this is something we can learn and be a part of 

---
Team

???

And being a part of is key. This is not something you do alone. 

Focus on Future Us. Research teams still don’t know how to work as teams. 

---
Champions illustration

???
helping find their teams, identify their trailhead, find the force. mixing metaphors here a bit but the idea is to move from the sad lonely research on the bottom left to finding teams and trailheads and navigating the open data science landscape safely. Not a scary, inaccessible, or inhospitable landscape.

Vision: Providing people an opportunity to see that it can be different. Ripple out. True culture change. 

---
OHI+Openscapes

???

Openscapes comes from my personal personal story as a researcher through the OHI and how through that I saw a bigger pattern that needed to be solved. And this is the 10 year anniversary of OHI so it's a good time to reflect on that as origins for Openscapes. 

---
Lessons learned: 

- default approaches to science aren't reproducible, efficient, or inclusive
- code openly & teach through the R community
- practice open science through the OHI
- be an open leader through Mozilla

<!---And I'm still learning
I learned how to flywheel with Erin Robinson
I learned how to be braver with Tara Robertson ---->

???
How can I combine these things and what I learned into a program that could accelerate teams doing open science and data science with community

I was turned into a Champion for open science because it transformed the way I work and the way I think. I wanted to pass this forward. Through the Champions program. 


---
OHI intro

used open data from the start. combining ~100 open data sets. but our code and analysis was closed.

???

My job with OHI for 6+ years was to contribute to our annual global assessment and lead the OHI+ program to help other teams use our science. An opportunity for me to learn closely doing research with my team and then turn around and help other teams

OHI informed how I work with people around data. I needed to fundamentally do my work in a diff way. I saw that other teams were having that same trouble. Seeing that others need that too. That’s what Openscapes is.

Build trust, confidence talking about data and sharing imperfect work. 

Seaside chats. PI-supported, not attended. 
Seaside chats. Prioritize time. Shared space. Normalize. Build up space to ask these questions, develop vocabulary around them. (stuff from CSCCE slides?)
PI doesn't need more meetings. TRUST WITHIN TEAM.

Identify how people work, identify the common parts where we are all reinventing. One concrete example: we were all spending a ton of time with Country names. 

Let me started talking about data and analysis we realized they were tedious common things we were all doing whether that was consolidating species names or location names saving data making plots we were all reinventing so through talking about this we were able to start putting that common code somewhere else where we could all you know somewhere where we could all access it and then normalize doing that this then let us find other common not only common problems but common ways to innovate together and take the next step we work on common documentation and then common automation and upskilling.

This flywheel is a way to grow and scale to truly be part of the open science movement through growth and scaling. This element here about training more mentors and building more curriculum and enabling them to build curriculum is a big part for work now. We're working with NASA to do this through the Earth data science cookbook and we're doing this also with the more foundation with protocols to bio

# MAIN POINT

Main point:: open science is a movement that will help you do BSILT

It includes you. 

Key to this is to focus on several things at the same time:
- data science
- teamwork
- diversity, equity, and inclusion 
You engage with this movement through teams. And what I'd like you to leave this talk with is the idea that teams and community are all around you, supporting you in your research. 

THEME: As open science improves your daily life, you can also give back and help others. This is what the open science movement is. 


Main point:: Open, Reliable, and Transparent is a team effort  And what I'd like you to leave this talk with is the idea that teams and community are all around you, supporting you in your research.

## Open science as a movement

Open science is a movement that will help you do BSILT.

Daily benefit that then you can pass forward. 

DEI is a huge part of this.

I'll tell you about 2 examples: teams. 

You engage with this movement through teams.


Open science is a movement that will help you do better science in less time, and it's something that all ecologists can be a part of

(And while these days, we both feel like working as data scientists and teachers in R is a wonderfully supportive, collaborative, and inspiring space to work. But we didn’t always feel like this. )

Data science is an entryway to open science: turn open science from an idea to a daily benefit

???

For me it was really the R community that introduced and welcomed me to open science. These groups helped me feel welcome and included and helped me see that data science is an entryway to open science from an idea to a daily benefit

science as a movement that we could be a part of and that was a daily benefit to our work

. ENTRYWAY.
Many entryways to open science: I've seen data science as a criticaly entryway that meets researchers' immediate needs

So how do you do that? through teams.
